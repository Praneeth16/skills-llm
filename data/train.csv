External Description Str : How do you test a hundred million lines of code, every time a change is made? Help us build highly scalable, low-touch systems to allow our engineering efforts to scale while decreasing risk and cost. Use your engineering and problem solving skills to build new SDLC platform systems using cutting-edge technologies and design principles to solve challenging problems. Take ownership - both of what you build, and across our broader functional area. Our software engineers work with stakeholders across the globe within almost every area of the firm. Work on our multi-year greenfield initiative to build our strategic public-cloud regression test infrastructure, replacing decades’ worth of legacy systems and streamlining processes for our client engineers across the firm. THE ENGINEERING DIVISION Our team of engineers builds solutions to the most complex problems. We develop cutting-edge systems and processes that form the core of our key business and enable transactions to move in milliseconds. We provide real-time access to critical deal information and crunch billions of data points each day to inform firm-wide market insights and strategies. Team members have the opportunity to work at the forefront of technology innovation alongside industry leaders and make significant contributions to the field. WAVEFRONT ENGINEERING The SecDb SDLC Engineering team (Wavefront Engineering) provides development and deployment services to a large and diverse engineering community (circa. 3,500 engineers) that uses SecDb for running their products. We also provide services for the firm’s control functions to ensure change management adheres to our quality standards and regulatory obligations. The SecDb platform is principally used for risk management but is also employed widely for other functions. The platform supports both compiled (C++, Java, Scala) and scripted languages (Slang, the firm’s proprietary scripting language, JavaScript and Python) and facilitates over 2,000 production releases a day across a shared codebase and runtime. We want to modernize SecDb SDLC services to converge on vendor and open source solutions used more broadly in the firm and are seeking talented engineers to help shape the future of SecDb SDLC and deliver it to our users. Key to our success is to maintain a shared and rapid development environment while ensuring the effectiveness of the controls required for safeguarding the change activities. Responsibilities • Develop and enhance the testing frameworks that underpin SecDb’s software change management processes for all the languages stacks SecDb supports. • Help to uplift our regression analysis suite that helps to remove human investigation from the analysis of test failures. • Partner with colleagues across Engineering, Compliance, Risk and Audit to improve developer experience and controls. • Work with the broader SDLC team on convergence on a common set of vendor/open source solutions. Experience • Strong programming skills in one or more scripted and compiled programming languages • Experience with regression testing as a developer • Excellent communication, influencing, relationship building skills. • Passionate about the software development process and facilitating high frequency/high quality change across a vibrant and diverse user community HOW YOU WILL FULFILL YOUR POTENTIAL • Design, develop, test and document high-quality code in a structured, disciplined, and fast-moving environment. • Build relationships with stakeholders at all levels to help ensure we are building the best solutions for the problem space. • Take responsibility for project delivery as well as wider ownership in our functional area. • Apply a discerning mindset to production issues – always preferring a root cause fix over a temporary hack. SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE WE ARE LOOKING FOR • Technical, analytical, and love to dive into detail, as well as keeping broader goals in mind at all times. • Hungry to learn new concepts and technologies • Self-motivated and able to work to demanding schedules as a sole technical contributor, as well as partnering with others. • Not tied into one specific technology – we aim to use the best tool to solve the problem at hand. • Demonstrated proficiency and commercial experience with one or more mainstream programming languages such as Java, Scala, Python, Go • A proven track record of delivering projects • Experience gathering requirements and interacting with end users • Experience developing complex distributed systems • Experience with complex debugging and root-cause analysis • Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal: able to interact in a professional manner at all levels Preferred Qualifications • Experience building test or other SDLC tools • Scala The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals.

Today, we stand at the beginning of the next era, the AI computing era, ignited by a new computing model, GPU deep learning. This new model - where deep neural networks are trained to recognize patterns from massive amounts of data - has shown to be deeply effective at solving some of the most complex problems in everyday life. NVIDIA is widely considered to be one of the technology world's most desirable companies to work for. Are you creative and driven? Do you love a challenge? If so, we want to hear from you. NVIDIA is committed to fostering a diverse work environment and proud to be an equal opportunity employer. As we highly value diversity in our current and future employees, we do not discriminate (including in our hiring and promotion practices) on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status or any other characteristic protected by law.

Airline reservation systems, Banking and Financial systems, Online shopping, Factories/plants operations, etc. depend on swift resolution of problems. Our developers, many of whom have been with us for ten years or more, are able to piece together clues from the failures and come up with resolutions. For a member of this team, it can be exceedingly gratifying to see the immediate result of our solutions. Variety and fresh challenges are defining features of our work. The Customer Focused Engineering work environment is technically challenging: you need to understand complex code very quickly. You have to be able to conceptualize the interaction of software components and products together in a stack. You need to be prepared to expect the unexpected and have a strong focus on customer satisfaction. We're looking for people who are fast learners, highly motivated, and have great communications skills. If the opportunity to resolve real-world customer problems in the world's most important software products is exciting to you, then come join us. You can be guaranteed never to be bored!
